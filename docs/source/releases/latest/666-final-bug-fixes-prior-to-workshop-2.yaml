bug fix:
- description: |
    Add latest.rst to .gitignore because we will now auto-generate it within
    the doc build, so we do not want to update it within the repo.

    Additionally, add an "empty" version of latest.rst that indicates there are
    no current changes, and the latest release notes will be auto-generated
    with new content as changes are made.

    - '.gitignore'
